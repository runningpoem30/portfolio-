react is not even abrowser framework 
it is just a framework that does reconciliation very well 
for mobile we do react native
for web we have to add react dom 


react dom is something that renders something  -> it has the logic of how to rendert something on the screen
react is just an engine which tells us the difference 



react is an independent framework ---> you need three things to create a full stack application like react , react dom , and react router 


react is not seo optimized.
